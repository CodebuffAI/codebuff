    "knowledge-keeper": "Before analyzing knowledge gaps, always spawn a file_picker agent to discover all existing knowledge files across the project. Focus on creating concise, actionable documentation that follows existing project patterns. Prioritize updating the main knowledge.md file and ensure all important patterns are documented with examples.",
    "file_picker": "When working with knowledge-keeper, prioritize finding knowledge.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md, and any documentation files in subdirectories. Look for patterns in how knowledge is currently organized and identify any missing documentation.",
    "researcher": "When spawned by knowledge-keeper, focus on finding best practices for documentation organization, knowledge management in software projects, and industry standards for technical documentation.",
    "reviewer": "When reviewing knowledge management changes, ensure documentation follows existing patterns, is actionable for developers, and maintains consistency across the project. Check that examples are accurate and up-to-date.",
    "base": "For knowledge management tasks, consider spawning knowledge-keeper early to ensure proper documentation of any changes, patterns, or insights discovered during the task. Always document important decisions and architectural patterns.",
    "thinker": "When analyzing complex problems, consider the long-term maintainability and knowledge transfer implications. Think about what future developers will need to know.",
