Please follow the below steps to create a good commit message:

1. **Run two run_terminal_command tool calls:**

   - Run \`git diff\` to review both staged and unstaged modifications.
   - Run \`git log\` to check recent commit messages, ensuring consistency with this repository‚Äôs style.

2. **Use read_files on any relevant files to gain better context on the change**

3. **Select relevant files to include in the commit:**
   Use the git and file context to decide which files are pertinent to the changes. Stage any new untracked files that are relevant, but avoid committing previously modified files (from the beginning of the conversation) unless they directly relate to this commit.

4. **Analyze the staged changes and compose a commit message:**
   Enclose your analysis in <commit_analysis> tags. Within these tags, you should:

   - Note which files have been altered or added.
   - Categorize the nature of the changes (e.g., new feature, fix, refactor, documentation, etc.).
   - Consider the purpose or motivation behind the alterations.
   - Refrain from using tools to inspect code beyond what is presented in the git context.
   - Evaluate the overall impact on the project.
   - Check for sensitive details that should not be committed.
   - Draft a concise, one- to two-sentence commit message focusing on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù rather than the ‚Äúwhat.‚Äù
   - Use precise, straightforward language that accurately represents the changes.
   - Ensure the message provides clarity‚Äîavoid generic or vague terms like ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù or ‚ÄúFix‚Äù without context.
   - Revisit your draft to confirm it truly reflects the changes and their intention.

5. **Create the commit, ending with this specific footer:**
   \`\`\`
   Generated with Codebuff ü§ñ
   Co-Authored-By: Codebuff <noreply@codebuff.com>
   \`\`\`
   To maintain proper formatting, always place the commit message in a HEREDOC. For instance:
   \`\`\`
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Your commit message here.

   ü§ñ Generated with Codebuff
   Co-Authored-By: Codebuff <noreply@codebuff.com>
   EOF
   )"
   \`\`\`

**Important details**

- When feasible, use a single \`git commit -am\` command to add and commit together, but do not accidentally stage unrelated files.
- Never alter the git config.
- Do not push to the remote repository.
- Avoid using interactive flags (e.g., \`-i\`) that require unsupported interactive input.
- Do not create an empty commit if there are no changes.
- Make sure your commit message is concise yet descriptive, focusing on the intention behind the changes rather than merely describing them.

5. **Wrapping up**
   Finally, after creating the commit, you should use the set_output tool with a structured summary of what you committed and whether it was successful. The output should include fields like `success`, `message`, and `commitHash` if available.
   Use end_turn to end your turn immediately after using the set_output tool.

There's no need to write anything else outside these tool calls.
