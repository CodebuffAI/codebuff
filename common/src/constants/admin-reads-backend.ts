/**
 * Which store answers the god admin panel's reads (`freebuff/web/convex/admin.ts`:
 * user and project lookups, pause status, members, platform statistics):
 * the checked-in switch for moving them off platform Convex (COD-742,
 * "Admin, stats, tickets and email"). The data is the identity and project
 * spine mirrors, which their own lanes keep current; this switch moves only
 * the reads.
 *
 * - `convex`   Convex answers. The registry entries answer `unknown_function`.
 * - `shadow`   (default) the panel's queries render Convex and fetch Postgres
 *              in the background, logging `convex_pg_shadow_mismatch` on a
 *              difference. Its one action (`getUserDetails`) stays on Convex.
 * - `postgres` the registry answers every one of them. The Convex functions
 *              stay deployed as the rollback.
 *
 * A flip is a reviewed one-line diff here, never an env var.
