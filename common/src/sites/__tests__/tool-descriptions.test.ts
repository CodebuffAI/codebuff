/**
 * Reported 2026-10-15 as a GDPR complaint: "There is no documented pathway to
 * permanently delete data... no 'delete site' or 'wipe data' operation
 * available in the tooling", listing unpublish and "create a new site" as the
 * only dispositions.
 *
 * The complaint is right about the tools and wrong about the product. Erasure
 * has always existed — Delete site in the Sites panel calls
 * `DELETE /api/sites/:siteId`, which erases the Worker and its secrets, the D1
 * database, the R2 bucket and its objects, the custom domains and the site row
 * (`eraseSiteResources`) — but no `sites_*` description mentioned it, and
 * `sites_set_published` ended its retention sentence with no onward pointer. So
 * an agent asked how to remove a site's data had no true answer in its tools
 * and reported a gap that is not there.
 *
 * The fix is a description, not a tool: an agent must be able to name the
 * control, and must never be handed the control itself. Deleting someone's
 * database and bucket is a decision for the person, behind the panel's confirm.
