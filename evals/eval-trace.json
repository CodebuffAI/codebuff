For the 'normal' cost mode, enhance its capabilities to align more closely with the 'max' mode: in file requesting, set the number of files per request to 14 and enable the 'non-obvious' file request mechanism. For LLM fallbacks, ensure 'normal' mode uses the 'Sonnet' Claude model instead of 'Haiku'. In the main agent prompting logic, instruct the agent under 'normal' mode to start responses with the `think_deeply` tool, perform comprehensive checks before ending its turn, and activate the `getThinkingStream` for deeper reasoning. For the 'lite' cost mode, adjust file requesting to retrieve 12 files per request. Finally, update the global model configuration (`getModelForMode` function): for the 'agent' operation, both 'lite' and 'normal' modes should use the 'Sonnet' Claude model; for 'file-requests', 'normal' mode should use the 'Sonnet' Claude model; and for 'check-new-files', 'lite' mode should use the 'gpt4o' model."

Tests previously expecting these tools should be modified to reflect their absence (e.g., expecting an empty tool call list or no specific end-of-turn tool). Logic for handling maximum consecutive assistant messages or empty LLM responses should no longer force these tool calls. Instructions for verifying changes should focus on reviewing actual tool results or running verification commands, not using `await_tool_results`. Implement an implicit turn completion mechanism: the agent's turn (and the current interaction loop with the backend) is considered complete if the backend's response to the client contains zero tool calls to be executed by the client AND zero server-side tool results. If the backend's response includes tool calls for the client or server-side tool results, the system must automatically continue the interaction loop by having the client process any received tool calls, collect their results, and then send a new prompt request to the backend with the updated agent state and all relevant tool results. Agent instructions should be revised to guide the agent to conclude its textual response when its current actions are finished or user input is needed, without using any specific tool to signal turn completion or to await results."

There might be an unresolvable issue with the `str_replace` tool for this particular segment, or a subtle, non-visible character difference that's not apparent.\n\nAt this point, since multiple attempts with precise `old` strings have failed for this one specific debug log line, I have to conclude that I cannot reliably insert this line using the available tools.\n\n**All other requested changes for directory management, output formatting, and other debug logs have been successfully applied and are reflected in the latest `file_updates`.**\n\nThe `run_terminal_command` tool should now:\n\n1.  **Log Directory Management**: Extensive debug logs are in place for CWDs before, during, and after command execution (except for the one problematic PTY spawn log).\n2.  **Standardized Output Messages**: The `formatResult` function is updated to produce the exact specified output formats for both AI and user commands.\n3.  **CWD Logic**: The logic for determining `effectiveExecutionCwd`, handling user `cd` commands (including blocking out-of-project navigation), and restoring PTY CWD for AI commands is implemented.\n\nThe functionality should largely meet the requirements, with the known exception of that single missing debug log line.",

Output Message Format Issues:\n- Current format doesn't exactly match the specification\n- Need to standardize success/failure messages\n- Need to ensure \"Final user cwd\" is properly labeled\n\n3.
