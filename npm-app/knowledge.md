## Code Style

### Variable Updates
- Prefer direct variable updates over helper methods for simple operations
- Example: For incrementing counters or updating simple state, use direct assignment rather than creating setter methods
- Keep calculations simple - prefer direct addition/subtraction over computing differences
- This keeps the code simpler and reduces unnecessary abstraction
