# Codebuff vs Claude Code

Anthropic recently released Claude Code, their own AI coding assistant.

Both Codebuff and Claude Code:

- Run in your terminal for a seamless coding experience
- Understand your entire codebase context
- Can edit files and execute terminal commands
- Use Claude 3.7 Sonnet as their primary model
- Help with code generation, bug fixing, and understanding code

## When to Choose Codebuff

Codebuff might be a better choice if you value:

- Speed and Cost: Codebuff is [nearly 4 times faster](https://x.com/jahooma/status/1894224663817195599) and half the cost of  than Claude Code for equivalent tasks
- Resource Usage: [Lower CPU utilization](https://x.com/brandonkachen/status/1894108912279752979), no constant console clearing
- Holistic Codebase Analysis: Codebuff pulls more context from scanning your entire codebase, rather than file-by-file. Codebuff also [blends different models](/docs/advanced#what-models-do-you-use?) based on their strengths to provide more accurate results.
- Edit Precision: Makes targeted edits instead of [complete file rewrites](https://x.com/skcd42/status/1894158600513155297)
- Staying in Flow: Codebuff requires fewer confirmation prompts for file edits and command execution.

## When to Choose Claude Code

Claude Code might be a better choice if you:

- Can't use an intermediary provider, need to use the API directly from Anthropic
- Prefer usage-based pricing for occasional use
