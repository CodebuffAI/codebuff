# How does Codebuff actually work?

Codebuff starts by running through the source files in all subdirectories and parsing them with tree-sitter. We use this information to help find relevant files to you requests.

We have a stateless server that passes messages along to Anthropic or OpenAI and websockets to ferry data back and forth to clients. It effectively acts as a proxy between the client and our LLM providers.

We use a fast model to pick the relevant files, and we load them into context and Claude 3.7 Sonnet responds with the right edit. This main agent can also delegate to other agents, as when it does its planning step, or when searching for files.
