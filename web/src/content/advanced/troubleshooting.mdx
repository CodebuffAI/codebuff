# Troubleshooting

## Install failed

If `npm install -g codebuff` gave you an error, try using `sudo`. Otherwise, try reinstalling node with [nvm or fnm](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then run the codebuff install command again.

## Common Issues

### Connection Issues

If you see a message like this:

```bash
/Users/<youruser>/Library/pnpm/global/5/.pnpm/codebuff@1.0.153/node_modules/codebuff/dist/common/websockets/websocket-client.js:158
                    reject(new Error(`Websocket message with txid ${txid} timed out.`));                           ^

Error: Websocket message with txid 32 timed out.
    at Timeout._onTimeout (/Users/<youruser>/Library/pnpm/global/5/.pnpm/codebuff@1.0.153/node_modules/codebuff/dist/common/websockets/websocket-client.js:158:28)
    at listOnTimeout (node:internal/timers:594:17)
    at process.processTimers (node:internal/timers:529:7)

Node.js v22.12.0
```

it means you're having connection issues. In that case, try:

1. Check your internet connection.
2. Try logging out and back in with `logout` followed by `login`.

### Command Not Found

If you see "command not found" when trying to run Codebuff:

1. Ensure Codebuff is installed globally: `npm install -g codebuff`
2. Check that your PATH includes npm's global bin directory
3. Try running `which codebuff` to verify the installation location

### Directory Not Empty

If you see an error like this:

```bash
npm ERR! code ENOTEMPTY
npm ERR! syscall rename
npm ERR! path /some/path/to/node_modules/codebuff
npm ERR! dest /some/path/to/node_modules/.codebuff-SOMEHASH
npm ERR! errno -66
npm ERR! ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty, rename '/some/path/to/node_modules/codebuff' -> '/some/path/to/node_modules/.codebuff-SOMEHASH'
```

It means you have a directory named `.codebuff-SOMEHASH` in your node_modules directory. This is a temporary directory created by npm when installing packages. You can safely delete this directory and try again:

```bash
rm -rf /some/path/to/node_modules/.codebuff-SOMEHASH
```
