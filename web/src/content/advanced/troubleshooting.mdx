## Common Issues

### Connection Issues

If you see a message like this:

```bash
/Users/<youruser>/Library/pnpm/global/5/.pnpm/codebuff@1.0.153/node_modules/codebuff/dist/common/websockets/websocket-client.js:158
                    reject(new Error(`Websocket message with txid ${txid} timed out.`));                           ^

Error: Websocket message with txid 32 timed out.
    at Timeout._onTimeout (/Users/<youruser>/Library/pnpm/global/5/.pnpm/codebuff@1.0.153/node_modules/codebuff/dist/common/websockets/websocket-client.js:158:28)
    at listOnTimeout (node:internal/timers:594:17)
    at process.processTimers (node:internal/timers:529:7)

Node.js v22.12.0
```

it means you're having connection issues. In that case, try:

1. Check your internet connection.
2. Try logging out and back in with `logout` followed by `login`.

### Command Not Found

If you see "command not found" when trying to run Codebuff:

1. Ensure Codebuff is installed globally: `npm install -g codebuff`
2. Check that your PATH includes npm's global bin directory
3. Try running `which codebuff` to verify the installation location
