# Overview

Codebuff's agent system allows you to customize and extend the behavior of AI agents through **Agent Templates**.

## Why Multi-Agent Systems Excel at Code Generation

Traditional single-agent AI assistants often struggle with complex programming tasks because they try to handle everything at once. Codebuff's multi-agent architecture breaks down complex workflows into specialized, focused tasks that work together seamlessly.

### The Power of Specialization

Just like how software engineering teams have specialists (frontend developers, backend engineers, DevOps experts), Codebuff's agents each excel at specific tasks:

- **Code Generation Agents** - Focus purely on writing clean, functional code
- **Review Agents** - Specialize in catching bugs, security issues, and style violations
- **Research Agents** - Expert at finding relevant documentation and examples
- **Planning Agents** - Break down complex requirements into actionable steps
- **File Discovery Agents** - Navigate large codebases to find relevant files

So when you ask Codebuff to "refactor this authentication system," here's how multiple agents collaborate:

1. **File Picker Agent** - Scans your codebase to find all authentication-related files
2. **Research Agent** - Looks up current best practices for authentication patterns
3. **Planning Agent** - Creates a step-by-step refactoring plan
4. **Base Agent** - Implements the code changes following the plan
5. **Reviewer Agent** - Examines the changes for security vulnerabilities and code quality

This collaborative approach consistently produces better results than a single agent trying to handle all these concerns simultaneously.
