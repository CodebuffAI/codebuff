# How Codebuff Supercharged Benjamin Bryant's Coding Workflow

## Setting the Scene: The Day-to-Day of an Investment Fund

Benjamin Bryant’s job is all about balance. As someone who runs an investment fund focused on YC startups, he’s constantly juggling fundraising, managing LPs, and reviewing countless companies for potential deals. On top of that, he’s built much of the fund’s operational software himself, blending a mix of Next.js frontends and a Rails API backend.

"It’s janky but substantial," Ben admits, describing his codebase. With every new feature or process, the lack of a cohesive architecture means adding to the system can take days. "It’s like playing mental ping-pong," he jokes, "jumping from pitching LPs to debugging Rails just destroys focus."

## The Struggle: Manual Workarounds or Automation Hell?

Before discovering Codebuff, Ben often faced a tough choice:

- Spend days writing and debugging code for a new feature.

- Find a manual workaround to save time.

“The goal isn’t to build the perfect system,” Ben says, "It’s to pull in more capital and move faster."

This mentality meant he sometimes let go of certain refinements in favor of quick and dirty solutions — anything to keep the business moving.

## Enter Codebuff: A Game-Changer

Ben started using Codebuff, an AI-powered coding assistant, and his approach to development shifted overnight. With the tool, **tasks that once felt like two-day commitments now take two hours.**

Ben learned about Codebuff from is friend Finbarr, a 10x developer he deeply admires. Ben recalls, "Finbarr’s one of the best natural developers I’ve ever worked with, and he’s using Codebuff daily. That really resonated with me — if someone like him finds it valuable, I know I’m on the right track."

One standout example was his recent project generating tear sheets for companies. The feature required building APIs, scripting, data models, and integrating a PDF generator — tasks that typically stretched into multi-day efforts. "Codebuff made it manageable," Ben recalls. "In just a short order, I was able to pull together everything I needed without the usual headaches." This shift, he notes, underscores the tool’s value for streamlining even the most intricate tasks.

## The Learning Curve

Adopting a new tool always comes with hiccups. For Ben, the biggest challenge was integrating Codebuff into his complex multi-repo workflow. His projects often span multiple sub-repositories that are scattered across his filesystem. He manages them by linking them all in a single VS Code workspace.

"It works," he laughs, "but it’d be nice if Codebuff could reference external repositories more seamlessly."

Despite these quirks, Ben quickly adapted by treating Codebuff like a junior developer by providing feedback, iterating, and refining outputs until they aligned with his expectations.

## Iteration: The Secret Sauce

Ben’s process with Codebuff mirrors how he might guide a junior dev.

1. High-Level Instructions: He starts by clearly outlining what he needs.
2. Review: Once Codebuff generates code, he checks it against his vision.
3. Refinement: He provides feedback and lets the tool iterate further.

**"It’s like having an extension of your brain,"** he says. "I can focus on objectives instead of getting lost in implementation details."

## Rethinking Development

With Codebuff, Ben’s perspective on feature development has fundamentally changed.

"I can afford to take on higher-order features I’d have avoided before," he explains. The tool doesn’t just save time; it encourages experimentation and faster iteration.

Instead of deliberating for hours or coding something only to backtrack, Ben can try out ideas quickly and move forward. "The iteration cycle is so much faster," he notes.

## Reflections and Room for Improvement

Looking back, Ben wishes he’d understood the full potential of Codebuff sooner. While it streamlined many processes, he points out that some quirks, such as its handling of multi-repo workflows, could still use refinement. "It’s a great tool," he says, "but there’s room to make it even better for more complex setups."

"It’s not just about filling in code faster," he explains. "It’s about leveraging best practices, saving research time, and amplifying your productivity."

He also recommends others dive in with specific projects and allow themselves the flexibility to learn as they go.

## Coding, Optimized

Ben’s experience with Codebuff isn’t just about development; it’s about leveraging tools to work smarter. Whether it’s building tear sheets in hours or tackling features he’d previously shelved, Codebuff has fundamentally changed how he approaches his work.

An interesting perspective came from Ben’s conversations with his friend, Finbarr, a developer he deeply respects for his coding craftsmanship. “Finbarr’s one of the best natural developers I’ve ever worked with,” Ben shared. “When he told me he uses Codebuff daily, it really resonated. It’s a tool that even the most seasoned coders see as an extension of their capabilities.”

For Ben, it’s not about making things perfect. It’s about making them possible. And with Codebuff, that’s easier than ever.
