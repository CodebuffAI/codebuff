# How Codebuff Increases Developer Productivity

Benjamin Bryant runs an early-stage investment fund that focuses on Y Combinator startups. A lifelong programmer who's been coding since he was "yea tall," Ben built most of his fund's internal technology stack.

In his day to day, he switches between different roles rapidly, going from coding to investor meetings and founder pitches. Before Codebuff, each new software feature would often take at least an afternoon to implement, with more complex one requiring several days.

## Enter Codebuff 
Codebuff helped Ben reduce implementation time down to minutes, not hours.

> In 10 minutes, Codebuff will get me most of the way there... It's like having an extension of your brain.

Better yet, Codebuff enables him take on more ambitious projects. He now has more time to iterate and build larger projects.

For example, Ben needed to build a system to generate tear sheets for their portfolio companies. Previously, he said that he might have pushed it off or cobbled together a manual workaround - a classic "I'll build it properly later" that never happens. Instead, he just described what he wanted to Codebuff, and within minutes it had scaffolded out the PDF generation, API integrations, and data models. He still had to tweak things here and there, but Codebuff had done the heavy lifting.

Codebuff didn't just spit out generic code – it matched their patterns, formatting, even their quirky architectural decisions. It was like having a really sharp junior dev who perfectly gets your coding style.

For someone who's been coding forever but can't dedicate solid blocks of time to it anymore, this tool is a game-changer. Codebuff isn't about replacing developers – it's about making experienced devs more effective.
