# Codebuff as an Engineer

[Oliver Lukesch](https://blog.luk.sh/) is building [StartMatch](https://startmatch.ai/), a platform to help European companies streamline their grant application process. He faced a familiar challenge: maintaining development velocity while ensuring code quality.

## Initial Attempts

At first, Oliver various other tools: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and others. Oliver had asked all tools to do the following: implement a complete feature, including the endpoint and supporting code. Most tools responded with boilerplate that ignored his project's specific needs or, worse, produced entirely irrelevant code. Refactors thus took him a lot of time and effort, taking time away from other tasks.

## The Right Solution

But something clicked when Oliver tried Codebuff. Not only did Codebuff understood his codebase structure but it also respected his established patterns and libraries. The `knowledge.md` file he made contains details about the codebase and helps Codebuff make better code edits. Even when Codebuff wasn't perfect, he only had to do minor fixes—usually just adding a missing import or tweaking the structure slightly.

Oliver now spends less time on routine coding tasks and more on strategic planning with Codebuff's help. When another developer joined the team, Oliver introduced them to Codebuff, confident in its ability to maintain consistent coding standards across the project.

Finding the right AI coding assistant wasn't just about automating tasks—it was about finding a tool that could truly understand and adapt to a project's needs. Codebuff helps Oliver focus on the important stuff and handle the rest. In the fast-paced world of startup development, that kind of reliability proves invaluable.
