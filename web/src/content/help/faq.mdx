# Frequently Asked Questions

## Data & Privacy

### Do you store my code? 🔒
Nope! We're just a bridge between you and the AI models. Your code stays on your machine - we only pass what's needed for each request to OpenAI and Anthropic. We do keep some chat logs temporarily for debugging, and store basic chat history, but that's it. Soon we'll have a Privacy Mode that won't store anything at all!

### How secure is my code? 🛡️
We take security seriously:
- Everything's encrypted with HTTPS
- Your code stays local
- Logs are automatically cleaned up
- You're always in control

### Can I use Codebuff with private repos? 🤫
Absolutely! Since Codebuff runs locally, it works with any repository - public, private, or even that side project you haven't told anyone about yet.

## Usage & Features

### Can I customize how Codebuff works? 🎛️
You bet! Create `knowledge.md` files to teach Codebuff about your project. Think of them like notes you'd write for another developer joining your team. Codebuff reads these files and adapts to your project's patterns and preferences.

### Can I tell Codebuff to ignore certain files? 📁
Yep! Codebuff automatically respects your `.gitignore`, and you can create a `.codebuffignore` file for anything else you want to exclude. Perfect for keeping Codebuff focused on what matters.

### How do I handle big projects? 🏗️
We've got you covered:
- Start in specific directories (`cd backend`)
- Use `.codebuffignore` strategically
- Break big changes into smaller bits
- Use `--pro` mode for better context

### Can I use Codebuff offline? 🌐
Not yet - we need an internet connection to talk to the AI models. But hey, that's what airplane mode is for, right?

## Cost & Credits

### Why does Codebuff cost more than alternatives? 💰
Fair question! We do more heavy lifting behind the scenes - more context analysis, smarter file handling, and deeper understanding of your codebase. It's like the difference between a quick chat and a proper code review.

### How can I keep costs down? 📊
Smart strategies to stretch your credits:
- Use `--lite` mode for simple stuff
- Work in subdirectories
- Keep your `.codebuffignore` tidy
- Track usage with `codebuff usage`

### What's in the free tier? 🎁
You get:
- Monthly credit allowance
- All core features
- Community support
- Basic integrations
Plus, you can earn more credits through referrals!

## Technical Stuff

### How does version control work? 🔄
Codebuff plays nice with your existing git workflow:
- Changes go to your working directory
- You control what gets committed
- Standard git commands work as expected
- Easy to undo if needed

### IDE integration? 👨‍💻
Right now we're terminal-based, but IDE integration is on our roadmap. Stay tuned!

### What about type safety? 🎯
Don't worry - Codebuff understands type systems and keeps your code type-safe. No more "any" type sneaking in!
