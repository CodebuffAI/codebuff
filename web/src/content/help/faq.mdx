# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do you store my data?

We don't store your codebase. Mostly our server is a thin client that passes data along to OpenAI and Anthropic. We store logs of your chats temporarily to help us debug. We also store portions of your chat history in our database. Soon, we plan to support a Privacy Mode where no data at all is stored.

## Can I specify custom instructions for Codebuff?

Yes! We recommend you create knowledge.md files to give Codebuff more context about your codebase, like you're introducing it to another engineer. All file names ending in knowledge.md are loaded into context automatically, and you can use the files to do your own prompt engineering for Codebuff.

If you do not have a knowledge.md file, Codebuff typically will not create one, but it will update existing knowledge.md files autonomously. The Codebuff codebase currently has a knowledge.md in almost every directory.

## Can I tell Codebuff to ignore certain files?

Codebuff by default will not read files that are specified in your .gitignore. You can also create a '.codebuffignore' file to specify additional files or folders to ignore.

## Why is Codebuff so expensive?

We realize it costs a bit more than alternatives, but in exchange, Codebuff does more LLM calls using more examples from your codebase, leading to better code edits.

## I have more questions!
