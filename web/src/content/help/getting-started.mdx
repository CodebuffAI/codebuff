# Getting Started with Codebuff

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Let's get you up and running with Codebuff, your new AI programming buddy. Whether you're building the next big thing or just fixing some bugs, we'll help you code faster and smarter.

## Quick Start

First things first, let's install Codebuff:

<CodeDemo language="bash">npm install -g codebuff</CodeDemo>

That's it! Jump right in by running:

<CodeDemo language="bash">codebuff</CodeDemo>

Want to optimize for speed or quality? We've got you covered:

<CodeDemo language="bash">
  codebuff --lite  # Faster, lighter on credits
  codebuff --pro   # Deeper understanding, better results
</CodeDemo>

## Setting Up Your Project

Before we dive in, let's set up your project for success:

1. Got Git? Great! If not:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
   This lets you track changes and undo anything you don't like.

2. Tell Codebuff what to ignore:
   ```bash
   echo "node_modules/" >> .codebuffignore
   echo "dist/" >> .codebuffignore
   ```
   Just like .gitignore, but for Codebuff!

3. Help Codebuff understand your project:
   ```bash
   # Create a knowledge file (think: project notes for AI)
   echo "# Project Overview" > knowledge.md
   ```

## Let's Write Some Code!

Here's what Codebuff can do for you:

### Need a New Component?
```bash
codebuff "Create a React component for user profiles with name, bio, and avatar"
```

### Found a Bug?
```bash
codebuff "Fix the type error in Button.tsx - it's not handling onClick properly"
```

### Time to Refactor?
```bash
codebuff "Refactor this auth code to use the new API endpoints"
```

### Documentation Anyone?
```bash
codebuff "Add JSDoc comments to these utility functions"
```

## Pro Tips ðŸŽ¯

### Start Small
- Begin with simple requests
- Get a feel for how Codebuff thinks
- Use `diff` to review changes before they're applied

### Use Version Control
- Keep your work committed
- Review changes with `git diff`
- Easily undo anything you don't like

### Stay Organized
- Work in specific directories for focus
- Use knowledge files like documentation
- Keep your .codebuffignore clean

### Be Specific
- Reference file paths when relevant
- Break big tasks into smaller steps
- Tell Codebuff what you're trying to achieve

## Managing Costs

Keep those credits in check:

1. Choose Your Mode:
   - `--lite`: Quick changes, fewer credits
   - Default: Balanced approach
   - `--pro`: Deep understanding when you need it

2. Stay Focused:
   ```bash
   cd src/components
   codebuff
   ```
   Less context = fewer credits used

3. Track Usage:
   ```bash
   codebuff usage
   ```
   Keep an eye on your credit balance
