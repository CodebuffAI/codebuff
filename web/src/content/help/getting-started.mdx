# Getting Started

Welcome! Let's get you set up with Codebuff, the AI coding agent.

## Installation

Install Codebuff globally using npm:

```bash
  npm install -g codebuff
```

## Basic Usage

Start using Codebuff in your project directory:

```bash
  codebuff
```

Or, start a new project with one of our [starter templates](https://github.com/CodebuffAI/codebuff-community/tree/main/starter-templates):

```bash
  codebuff --create nextjs project-name
```

That's it! Codebuff is now ready to help you with your coding tasks.

## Troubleshooting

If you get a permissions error during install, use `sudo npm install -g codebuff` on Mac/Linux or run a command prompt as an admin on Windows.

If it still fails with more permissions, you should [reinstall Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
