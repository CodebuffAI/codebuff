# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Hiccups

### Lost Connection? 🔌

If Codebuff seems to have wandered off:

1. Quick internet check (we've all been there!)
2. Try `codebuff login` - maybe your session timed out
3. Give it a fresh start - close and reopen
4. Check our status page if things still feel off

### Running Slow? 🐌

Speed things up by:

1. Start in the right spot: `cd src/components`
2. Clean up that .codebuffignore file (less files = faster thinking)
3. Switch to `--lite` mode for quick wins
4. Make sure your internet's happy

### Credits Vanishing Too Fast? 💸

Keep those credits lasting longer:

1. Check your usage: `codebuff usage`
2. Use `--lite` mode for the simple stuff
3. Work in subdirectories when possible
4. Review what files you're ignoring

### Changes Not Sticking? 🤔

When file changes aren't working:

1. Check if files are locked in your editor
2. Run `diff` to see what's actually changing
3. Try `undo` and give it another shot
4. Make sure you've got write permissions

## Error Messages Decoded

### Auth Issues 🔑

- "Not authenticated" → Run `codebuff login`
- "Session expired" → Time for a fresh login
- "Invalid token" → Clear those creds and try again
- "No permission" → Double-check your account status

### Too Many Requests 🚦

- "Rate limit hit" → Take a quick breather
- "Quota maxed" → Time to check those usage limits
- "Service busy" → Give it a minute
- "API limit" → Maybe time to upgrade?

### File System Fails 📁

- "Permission denied" → Check those file permissions
- "File not found" → Double-check that path
- "Can't write" → Make sure you can modify files
- "Path too long" → Time to shorten those file names

## Detective Mode 🔍

### Debug Logging

Need to dig deeper? Try:

```bash
# Turn on the spotlight
export CODEBUFF_DEBUG=1
codebuff

# See what's happening
cat ~/.codebuff/debug.log
```

### Cache Problems

If things feel stuck:

```bash
# Fresh start
rm -rf ~/.codebuff/cache

# Try again
codebuff
```

### Network Detective

Connection acting up?

```bash
# Health check
codebuff doctor

# Quick status check
codebuff status
```

### Version Mismatch

Make sure you're up to date:

```bash
# What version are you running?
codebuff --version

# Get the latest and greatest
npm install -g codebuff@latest
```

## Stay Sharp 🎯

### Regular Checkups

1. Keep Codebuff fresh with updates
2. Watch those credit levels
3. Review what files you're ignoring
4. Keep knowledge files current

### Best Practices

1. Use git - it's your safety net
2. Start in the right directory
3. Break big changes into bite-sized pieces
4. Always review before applying

### Speed Optimization

1. Keep that .codebuffignore tidy
2. Pick the right mode for the job
3. Focus on relevant directories
4. Clean cache when things feel slow
