# Under the Hood: AI Models ðŸ§ 

Ever wonder what's powering your coding assistant? Let's peek behind the curtain!

## Our Model Stack

### Primary Workhorse: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
This is our go-to for most coding tasks. Why? It's got:
- Deep understanding of code structure
- Excellent context handling
- Strong type system awareness
- Reliable code generation

### Quick Scout: Claude 3.5 Haiku
Our file-finding specialist. It's:
- Lightning fast
- Context-aware
- Cost-effective
- Perfect for quick decisions

### Backup Brain: GPT-4o-mini
Steps in for specific tasks using OpenAI's Predicted Outputs API. Great for:
- Pattern matching
- Code completion
- Quick validations
- Syntax checking

## Power Modes ðŸŽ®

We've got different modes to match your needs:

### Pro Mode (`--pro`)
```bash
codebuff --pro
```
- Uses Sonnet for everything (including file search)
- Pulls in more context
- Better for complex changes
- Perfect for architectural work

### Normal Mode (default)
```bash
codebuff
```
- Balanced approach
- Haiku for file search
- Sonnet for coding
- Great for most tasks

### Lite Mode (`--lite`)
```bash
codebuff --lite
```
- Uses Deepseek V3 (1/10th the cost!)
- Minimal file fetching
- Perfect for quick changes
- Great for simple tasks

## When to Use What? ðŸŽ¯

### Use Pro Mode When:
- Refactoring complex systems
- Working with intricate types
- Making architectural changes
- Needing deep context understanding

### Use Normal Mode When:
- Writing new features
- Fixing bugs
- Adding tests
- Most everyday tasks

### Use Lite Mode When:
- Making quick edits
- Working on simple features
- Adding documentation
- Watching your credit usage

## Pro Tips ðŸ’¡

1. Start Light:
   ```bash
   codebuff --lite "Add JSDoc to this function"
   ```
   Perfect for simple changes!

2. Go Pro for Complex Stuff:
   ```bash
   codebuff --pro "Refactor auth system to use OAuth"
   ```
   When you need the extra brainpower.

3. Mix and Match:
   - Start with lite mode
   - Switch to pro if needed
   - Find your sweet spot

Remember: The best mode is the one that gets your job done efficiently. Don't be afraid to experiment and find what works best for your workflow!

## Looking Ahead ðŸ”®

We're constantly evaluating and integrating new models. Our goal? Make Codebuff smarter while keeping it cost-effective. Stay tuned for more improvements!
