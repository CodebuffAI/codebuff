# Special commands

Use these commands inside Codebuff:

- `login` to log into Codebuff
- `undo` or `u`: Undo last change
- `redo` or `r` : Redo change
- `diff` or `d` to show changes from last assistant response
- `ESC` or `Ctrl/Cmd + C` to stop generation
- `usage` to show current credit usage
- `clear` to clear terminal screen

## Command Line Flags

Get help:
- `--help`: See other options

When starting Codebuff, you can use these flags to control the cost/quality tradeoff:

- `--lite`: Use Gemini Flash 2.5 Thinking for faster, more economical responses
- `--max`: Use a hybrid of Gemini Pro 2.5 and Sonnet for more comprehensive responses with enhanced reasoning

## Terminal commands

- Type two spaces in a row to insert a line break - useful for writing multi-line prompts
- Use Codebuff like a terminal by entering terminal commands directly, like `cd backend` or `npm test`
- `/run <command>`: run long terminal commands explicitly
