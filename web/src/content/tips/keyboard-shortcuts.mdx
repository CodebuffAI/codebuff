# Special commands

Use these commands inside Codebuff:

- `login` to log into Codebuff
- `undo` or `u`: Undo last change
- `redo` or `r` : Redo change
- `diff` or `d` to show changes from last assistant response
- `ESC` or `Ctrl/Cmd + C` to stop generation
- `usage` to show current credit usage
- `clear` to clear terminal screen

## Command Line Flags

Get help:
- `--help`: See other options

When starting Codebuff, you can use these flags to control the cost/quality tradeoff:

- `--lite`: Use budget models & fetch fewer files for more economical responses
- `--max`: Use higher quality models & fetch more files for more comprehensive responses â€“ o1 for deep thinking, 3.5 Sonnet for picking files (also accepts `--o1`)

## Terminal commands

- Use Codebuff like a terminal by entering terminal commands directly, like `cd backend` or `npm test`
- `/run <command>`: run long terminal commands explicitly
