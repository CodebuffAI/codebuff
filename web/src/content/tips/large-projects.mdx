# Working with Large Projects

## Directory-Based Approach

When working with large codebases, start Codebuff from specific directories to maintain focus:

```bash
cd backend
codebuff
```

This helps Codebuff concentrate on relevant files and provide more targeted assistance.

## Knowledge Organization

For large projects:
- Create separate knowledge.md files in key directories
- Focus each knowledge file on its directory's specific concerns
- Link related concepts across knowledge files
- Keep root knowledge.md for project-wide concepts

## Effective Communication

When working with large codebases:
- Be specific about file locations
- Reference related files explicitly
- Break large changes into smaller, focused requests
- Use the `--pro` mode for better context understanding

## Performance Tips

- Use `.codebuffignore` to exclude irrelevant directories
- Start in subdirectories when possible
- Break large refactoring tasks into smaller chunks
- Let Codebuff handle file discovery instead of listing all files
