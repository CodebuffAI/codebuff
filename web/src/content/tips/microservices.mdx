# Working with Microservices

## Project Organization

### Repository Structure

```
services/
  auth-service/
    knowledge.md
    src/
  user-service/
    knowledge.md
    src/
  api-gateway/
    knowledge.md
    src/
```

### Knowledge Management

- Create service-specific knowledge files
- Document service boundaries
- Track dependencies
- Maintain API contracts

## Development Patterns

### Service Communication

- Document API contracts
- Maintain consistent patterns
- Version interfaces
- Handle failures gracefully

### Code Generation

```bash
# Generate service skeleton
codebuff "Create new payment-service structure"

# Add API endpoints
codebuff "Add payment processing endpoint"

# Generate client
codebuff "Create TypeScript client for payment API"
```

### Testing Strategy

- Unit test services
- Integration tests
- Contract testing
- Performance testing

## Best Practices

### Service Independence

- Maintain clear boundaries
- Document dependencies
- Version APIs
- Handle failures

### Consistency

- Use shared libraries
- Follow team patterns
- Document exceptions
- Maintain standards

### Deployment

- Version services
- Track dependencies
- Document rollout
- Monitor health

## Common Workflows

### New Service

```bash
# 1. Generate structure
codebuff "Create service skeleton"

# 2. Add core logic
codebuff "Implement main endpoints"

# 3. Add tests
codebuff "Generate service tests"

# 4. Document API
codebuff "Create OpenAPI spec"
```

### API Changes

```bash
# 1. Plan changes
codebuff "Plan API update"

# 2. Update service
codebuff "Implement new endpoint"

# 3. Update clients
codebuff "Update API client"

# 4. Add tests
codebuff "Add integration tests"
```

## Tips for Success

### Development

- Start small
- Iterate quickly
- Test thoroughly
- Document clearly

### Deployment

- Version carefully
- Deploy gradually
- Monitor closely
- Rollback quickly

### Maintenance

- Update regularly
- Monitor performance
- Track dependencies
- Document changes
