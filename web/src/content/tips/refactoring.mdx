# Where Codebuff Shines

## Refactor files

Codebuff is pretty good at rewriting files. It excels at rewriting existing files into another language and reorganizing the codebase.

If you have projects with particular patterns and styles, Codebuff can help you keep them consistent as you develop.

## Multi-file edits

No more copy/paste! Codebuff is good at making changes that involve multiple files.
