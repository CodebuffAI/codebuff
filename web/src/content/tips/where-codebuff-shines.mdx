# Where Codebuff Shines

## Refactor Files

Codebuff excels at rewriting and reorganizing code. Here are some examples of what it can do:

- Convert files between languages while preserving functionality
- Update code to use new APIs or libraries
- Implement consistent patterns across your codebase
- Reorganize file structure for better maintainability

If you have projects with particular patterns and styles, Codebuff can help you keep them consistent as you develop.

## Multi-file Edits

No more copy/paste! Codebuff is particularly good at making changes that involve multiple files:

- Rename functions, classes, or variables across the entire codebase
- Update API endpoints and their corresponding client code
- Modify shared types and update all their usages
- Add new features that require changes in multiple parts of the application

## Code Generation

Codebuff can help generate boilerplate code and common patterns:

- Create new API endpoints with proper logging and error handling
- Generate TypeScript types from existing code
- Add test cases for new functionality
- Create documentation files in markdown format

## Terminal Integration

Codebuff can run terminal commands to help with development tasks:

- Install new dependencies with the correct package manager
- Run type checks and tests after making changes
- Search through code using grep or other tools
- Move, rename, or delete files as part of refactoring

## Knowledge Management

Codebuff maintains knowledge files (files ending in `knowledge.md`) that capture important context about your codebase:

- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Architecture decisions and their rationale
- Best practices for different parts of the codebase

Feel free to update them as you see fit! Codebuff will load your codebase's knowledge files every time it starts up, so it has full context into your project's unique needs and quirks.
