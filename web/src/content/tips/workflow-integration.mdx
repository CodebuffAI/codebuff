# Integrating Codebuff Into Your Workflow

## Development Cycles

### Planning Phase
- Use Codebuff to break down complex features
- Generate implementation plans
- Create test scenarios
- Estimate complexity

### Implementation
- Start with skeleton code generation
- Iteratively refine implementations
- Use knowledge files for consistency
- Break large changes into manageable chunks

### Code Review
- Ask Codebuff to review changes
- Generate test coverage
- Add documentation
- Ensure consistency with project standards

### Maintenance
- Debug issues efficiently
- Refactor with confidence
- Keep documentation current
- Update dependencies safely

## Team Collaboration

### Knowledge Sharing
- Maintain shared knowledge files
- Document team conventions
- Share common patterns
- Track architectural decisions

### Code Standards
- Enforce consistent styling
- Maintain type safety
- Follow team patterns
- Document exceptions

### Review Process
- Pre-review cleanup
- Documentation updates
- Test coverage
- Performance considerations

## Project Management

### Task Breakdown
1. Start with high-level goals
2. Break into smaller tasks
3. Identify dependencies
4. Create implementation plan

### Progress Tracking
- Track completed changes
- Monitor test coverage
- Document decisions
- Update project status

### Quality Assurance
- Run automated tests
- Check type safety
- Verify documentation
- Review performance

## Common Workflows

### Feature Development
```bash
# 1. Plan the feature
codebuff "Plan implementation steps for user authentication"

# 2. Generate skeleton code
codebuff "Create basic structure for auth components"

# 3. Implement details
codebuff "Add password validation to LoginForm"

# 4. Add tests
codebuff "Generate unit tests for auth utils"
```

### Bug Fixing
```bash
# 1. Reproduce the issue
codebuff "Help debug the login error"

# 2. Analyze root cause
codebuff "Explain why the session expires early"

# 3. Implement fix
codebuff "Update session timeout handling"

# 4. Add regression test
codebuff "Create test to prevent timeout issues"
```

### Refactoring
```bash
# 1. Identify improvements
codebuff "Analyze auth code for refactoring opportunities"

# 2. Plan changes
codebuff "Plan migration to new auth system"

# 3. Implement gradually
codebuff "Update user service to new pattern"

# 4. Verify changes
codebuff "Check for missed auth updates"
```

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Group related changes
- Maintain clear boundaries
- Document dependencies
- Track technical debt

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests first
- Cover edge cases
- Maintain test quality
- Document test scenarios

### Documentation
- Update as you code
- Keep examples current
- Document decisions
- Share knowledge

### Performance
- Monitor impacts
- Test at scale
- Document bottlenecks
- Plan improvements

## Tips for Success

1. Regular Updates
   - Keep knowledge files current
   - Update documentation
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Review dependencies

2. Clear Communication
   - Be specific in requests
   - Document decisions
   - Share learnings
   - Track progress

3. Quality Focus
   - Maintain standards
   - Review changes
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document clearly

4. Continuous Improvement
   - Learn from feedback
   - Refine processes
   - Share knowledge
   - Adapt workflows
